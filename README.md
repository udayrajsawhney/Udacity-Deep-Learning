Your First Neural Network
- Introduction
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, you'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow. You'll also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!
- The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.
- Instructions
Download the project materials from our GitHub repository. You can get download the repository with git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git. 

## Project Two : Canine Breed Classifier (DCNN) 

- Project Overview
Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project! In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

- Along with exploring state-of-the-art CNN models for classification, you will make important design decisions about the user experience for your app. Our goal is that by completing this lab, you understand the challenges involved in piecing together a series of models designed to perform various tasks in a data processing pipeline. Each model has its strengths and weaknesses, and engineering a real-world application often involves solving many problems without a perfect answer. Your imperfect solution will nonetheless create a fun user experience!

## Project Three : Simpsons Script Generator (RNN/LSTM) 

- Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.

- Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git
This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.

## Project Four : Face Generation (CelebA Dataset) [Generative Adverserial Networks] 

- Introduction
In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.

- Getting the project files
The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the face_generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer


## Project Five : Fly a quadcopter [Deep Reinforcemnet Learning]

- Project Submission
In this project, you will design an agent that can fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice! Try to apply the techniques you have learnt in this module to find out what works best, but also feel free to come up with innovative ideas and test them.

You are encouraged to use the workspace in the next concept to complete the project. Alternatively, you can clone the project from the GitHub repository.
